# Car-crash-helpline-

It is an IOT based system created to alert and provide location to ambulance and family members when a person driving a car meets an accident. Node MCU(ESP8266) was used for creating the system. When a car meets an accident, the pressure sensor detects the occurrence of the accident and a PIR sensor used, detects whether people are present in the car. If all these conditions are met, then the system notifies the ambulance and family members about the accident and the location.
